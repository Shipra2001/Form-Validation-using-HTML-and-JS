# Form-Validation-using-HTML-and-JS 

HTML Structure: The HTML file includes a form with input fields for name, email, and password. Each field has an associated error message div that is initially hidden.

JavaScript Code

• DOMContentLoaded: Ensures that the DOM is fully loaded before running the script

• validateName: Checks if the name field is empty. Displays an error message if it is.

• validateEmail: Checks if the email field matches a regular expression pattern for valid email formats. Displays an error message if it does not

• validatePassword: Checks if the password field is at least 8 characters long. Displays an error message if it is not.

Event Listeners: Attached to the input fields to validate the input in real-time and to the form's submit event to prevent form submission if any input is invalid.
